     <font> Quality over clickbait In a creator economy ruled by clickbait and ad
      impressions, Medium's Partner Program is taking a stand for quality. As a
      partner, when your best stories are read by Medium members, a portion of
      their membership dues will be shared with you. Here are a few factors we
      consider in order to determine quality. 
      <br><hr>
      Member read time Members-only stories will earn money when a member reads your story for 30 seconds or
      more, and will continue to earn more the longer they keep reading. Long,
      thoughtful, reads are encouraged! Positive interactions You'll also earn
      more when members clap, highlight, reply, or engage with your story in
      other ways. Follower bonus When members follow you and continue to read
      and interact with your stories, you will be given a follower bonus.
      <br><hr>
      We encourage writers to share their stories with readers in a way that
      promotes community and audience building. Boost bonus Stories that are
      Boosted will also earn more for each read and interaction. We recommend
      that writers spend more time on fewer, high-quality stories to reach this
      bar.
